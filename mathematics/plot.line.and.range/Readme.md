# The purpose of this program

This python script is for my niece, because she discussed the following mathematics question with me. 
> If -2 < x + y < 3, and 1 < x - y < 4, 
> then what is the range of "z = 2x - 3y" ?

The correct answer is as below. And [answer.jpg](https://github.com/wang-qs/ForChildren/raw/master/mathematics/plot.line.and.range/answer.jpg) contains the approach to solution.
> 1 < z < 11

The question from my niece is that, 
>based on the above condition, the minimum value of x is -0.5, and the maximum value of y is 1, 
>then why the minimum of "z = 2x - 3y" is not -5 ?

The reason is that, 
> Although the mix of x is -0.5, and the max of y is 1, but x and y could not be their min value at the same time.
> For example, if they are the min value at the same time, then the condition "1 < x - y < 4" will be false.

To better understand the restrictions and the possible values of x and y. It is better to show my niece by picture. So I draw the following picture firstly.

But to make my niece and my children to be interesting in computer and programming, why not visulize it by program?  This is why I creted this python script, and the following picture is the final output.
