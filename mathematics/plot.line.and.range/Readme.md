# The purpose of this program

This python script is for my niece, because she discussed the following mathematics question with me. 
> If -2 < x + y < 3, and 1 < x - y < 4, 
> then what is the range of "z = 2x - 3y" ?

The correct answer is as below. And ![answer.jpg](https://github.com/wang-qs/ForChildren/raw/master/mathematics/plot.line.and.range/answer.jpg) contains the approach to solution.
> 1 < z < 11

The question from my niece is that, 
>based on the above condition, the minimum value of x is -0.5, and the maximum value is 1, 
>then why the minimum of "z = 2x - 3y" is not -5 ?
